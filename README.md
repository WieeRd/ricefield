Welcome to my rice field, nerd.

## Deployment

I honestly got tired of gimmicks and hassles of so called "dotfiles managers".

This repository is now simply a `$HOME/.config` directory managed by Git.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/WieeRd/ricefield ~/.config
```

Should be enough to get things started.

## The Workflow

I will (try to) document things later (hopefully).

## License

I stole this config from others and so others shall steal from me.
